How CryptSync should work:
==========================
(change title to "How CryptSync works" once everything is done)

1. Syncing folder pairs
2. Detecting changes
3. Handling of unencrypted files in the encrypted folder
4. Handling of missing files
5. Storing the user password


1. Syncing folder pairs
-----------------------
CryptSync syncs folder pairs. One folder is kept unencrypted so the
files in it can be used by any application. This is the folder the
user usually works with.
The second folder is kept encrypted, i.e. all files in that folder
are encrypted with a password the user provides. This folder is the
one that's used by e.g. SkyDrive, GDrive, DropBox, ...

The two folders are kept in sync, which means a change in a file in
the unencrypted folder results in that file getting encrypted and
stored in the encrypted folder. A change in the encrypted folder means
that the file is decrypted and stored in the unencrypted folder.

2. Detecting changes
--------------------
If the application is kept running, it monitors all folders for
changes. Once a change is detected, that change is synchronized to the
other folder of its pair. If a change is detected in both folders of
a pair for the same file at the same time, the change in the
unencrypted folder takes precedence. But that will happen very very
rarely if ever.

The 'last write time' of the files is used to detect changes.
Since at least SkyDrive relies upon this as well, there shouldn't be
a problem with this.

3. Handling of unencrypted files in the encrypted folder
--------------------------------------------------------
If the user saves an unencrypted file in the encrypted folder or the
cloud tool puts such a file there (in case the user uploaded a file
using e.g. a web interface), CryptSync will automatically encrypt that
file and remove the unencrypted file from the encrypted folder.
The file is of course synchronized to the unencrypted folder as well.

4. Handling of missing files
----------------------------
If a file got missing while CryptSync wasn't running, it can not know
on the next run whether that file got deleted, or it's pair file got
added. In that case, CryptSync will always treat the file as added
and sync it to its pair folder.

5. Storing the user password
----------------------------
To avoid the user having to enter the password every time CryptSync
starts up, the password can be saved to the registry. The password
is saved encrypted using the Windows logon credentials.
